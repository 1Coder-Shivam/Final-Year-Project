# Final-Year-Project
# Facial Recognition App Readme

This readme file provides instructions on how to get started with developing a facial recognition app using Android Studio. Follow the steps below to set up your development environment and begin building your app.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Android Studio: Download and install the latest version of Android Studio from the official website (https://developer.android.com/studio).

## Getting Started

1. *Clone the repository*: Start by cloning the repository for your facial recognition app to your local machine. You can use Git to clone the repository or download it as a ZIP file and extract it.

2. *Open the project in Android Studio*: Launch Android Studio and select "Open an existing Android Studio project." Navigate to the directory where you cloned or extracted the repository and select the project folder to open it.

3. *Set up the Android SDK*: Android Studio should automatically detect your installed Android SDK. If it doesn't, you can configure it by going to "File" -> "Project Structure" and selecting the appropriate SDK.

4. *Install required dependencies*: If the project has any external dependencies, you'll need to install them. The project's documentation should provide information on the required dependencies and how to install them. You can typically manage dependencies using Gradle, which is the build system used by Android Studio.

5. *Configure API keys*: If your facial recognition app relies on third-party APIs, you'll need to obtain API keys and configure them in your project. Consult the documentation of the APIs you're using to learn how to obtain and set up the required API keys.

6. *Build and run the app*: Once you've completed the previous steps, you can build and run the app. Connect an Android device to your computer or set up an Android Virtual Device (AVD) using the AVD Manager in Android Studio. Then, click on the "Run" button or use the keyboard shortcut to build and run the app on the selected device.

7. *Test the app*: Test the app on the device or emulator to ensure that it functions correctly. Follow the app's user interface and verify that the facial recognition features work as expected.

## Additional Resources

- Android Developer Documentation: Visit the official Android Developer website (https://developer.android.com) for comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and guides on Android app development using Android Studio.
- Stack Overflow: If you encounter any issues or have questions during development, Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com) is a great resource to search for solutions or ask for help from the developer community.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully set up your development environment and started building your facial recognition app using Android Studio. Refer to the project's documentation and the Android Developer resources to learn more about implementing facial recognition features and enhancing your app's functionality. Good luck with your development journey!
